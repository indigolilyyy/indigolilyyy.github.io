				<p>I'm Indigo Clark, a 19 year old mixed media artist currently living in Madison, Wisconsin. I attend UW-Madison and am pursuing a B.A. in Information Science and a B.S. in Art with an emphasis in Graphic Design. I've been drawing since I was a kid and have since taken interest in sequential storytelling and character design. In my career thus far, I have illustrated computer graphics for the visual novel, <a href= "https://store.steampowered.com/app/1477130/Trouble_Comes_Twice/">Trouble Comes Twice</a>, and a series of endpapers for a special edition book release from Illumicrate, a book merchandise company. I have self-published my own webcomic and I hope to someday create physical copies of my work as well.</p>
